The format for applying permissions is as follows: `\"[references][operator][modes]\"`. The references type is defined through three possible types: user `\"u\"`, group `\"g\"`, and other `\"o\"`. The operator is used to define if permissions get added `\"+\"` or removed `\"-\"`. There are three different modes that can be modified: read `\"r\"`, write `\"w\"`, and execute `\"x\"`. So, for example, `\"o-wrx\"` would remove all possible permissions for others. To add all permissions for others again, `\"o+wrx\"` would be used. In case the modification fails, this method will return a `string` containing information about the reason. Otherwise, an empty `string` is returned.
