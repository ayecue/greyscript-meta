The `classID` used for this object is `\"port\"`. Generally there are no restrictions in regards to which service runs on which port but there are some default ports for each service. List of the most common ports: `21` (FTP), `22` (SSH), `25` (SMTP), `80` (HTTP), `141` (SQL), `8080` (HTTP), `1222` (RSHELL), `1542` (Repository), `3306` (SQL), `3307` (SQL), `3308` (SQL), `6667` (Chat), `37777` (CCTV)"
