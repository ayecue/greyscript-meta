Alternatively, a maximum of captured `acks` can be specified for the command to stop automatically, saving the `\"file.cap\"` file as described above. To figure out how many ACKs are required, you can use the following formula: `\"300000 / (Power + 15)\"`. If there is an error, a `string` will be returned with the message indicating the problem. On success, it will return `null`, it is advised though to verify that the capture file actually exists.
